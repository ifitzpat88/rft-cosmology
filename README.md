Reality isn't built on spacetime. It's built on light. RFT (Relativistic Field Theory) unifies gravity, geometry, and matter through scalaronâ€“twistor dynamics. Visual simulators, falsifiable predictions, and the field Einstein never found.

# RFT: Relativistic Field Theory

### "Emergence, not assumption. Light, not mass. Geometry, not guesswork."

**RFT (Relativistic Field Theory)** is a unified field framework proposing that spacetime, gravity, and quantum fields emerge from the interactions of a scalar field (the *scalaron*) encoded within twistor space. This repository includes:

- Interactive simulations (Streamlit)
- The full theoretical document (RFT 12.0)
- Visual comparisons to Î›CDM, MOND, TeVeS, and GR
- Code for real-time curvature modeling, scalaron overlays, and gravitational structure

ðŸ“Œ This project is not submitted through traditional peer-reviewed pipelines. It is released in full, directly, for the public, scientific, and philosophical communities.

ðŸ“¡ `rft-cosmology.com` coming soon.
